# fNIRS_nirsLAB
Welcome everyone to my first git project. I have completed the script for the nirsLAB from NIRx. 

# What will this script do?
It is an automation script for nirsLAB, which will help the individuals doing the analysis part using NIRx systems. The approximate time taken by the single subject analysis is 20 minutes or so, which includes necessary steps like filtering the data, checking the channels, computing the hemodynamic states of the oxygenated and the deoxygenated haemoglobin, time series plot, grand averaging of a subject and much more things. 

This script will automate all the procedures that do not require human intelligence and are the same and repetitive in every analysis. For example, browsing the file of interest, application of filters (approx.), computing the hemodynamic states, time series plot, saving the file in ASCII format etc. The usage of this script results in a drop of 70% of the screen time. For instance, if you are spending 20 minutes for the analysis, by using this script, your work can be done in less than 5 minutes or so. 

# SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
No such requirement. Can be done on any computer. Make sure to have the system compatibilities as per NIRx guidelines while running the software and the script.

# THINGS TO TAKE CARE BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT
Make sure you have a clear understanding of the process that you want to perform in nirsLAB. Give special attention to the optode selection for specific individuals if you are looking for individual data from individual optode wrt to its position. Also, the script reader and editor of AutoIt should be installed in your computer. Make necessary changes according to your workflow and press F5 to run the script. Magic begins!

Cheers and best of luck!
